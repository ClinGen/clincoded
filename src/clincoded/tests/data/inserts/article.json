A gene for ACH was recently localized to 4p16.3 by linkage analyses. The ACH candidate region includes the gene encoding fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3), which was originally considered as a candidate for the Huntington's disease gene. DNA studies revealed point mutations in the FGFR3 gene in ACH heterozygotes and homozygotes. The mutation on 15 of the 16 ACH-affected chromosomes was the same, a G-->A transition, at nucleotide 1138 of the cDNA. The mutation on the only ACH-affected chromosome 4 without the G-->A transition at nucleotide 1138 had a G-->C transversion at this same position. Both mutations result in the substitution of an arginine residue for a glycine at position 380 of the mature protein, which is in the transmembrane domain of FGFR3.",

        "abstract": "Achondroplasia, the most common cause of chondrodysplasia in man (1 in 15,000 live births), is a condition of unknown origin characterized by short-limbed dwarfism and macrocephaly. More than 90% of cases are sporadic and there is an increased paternal age at the time of conception of affected individuals, suggesting that de novo mutations are of paternal origin. Affected individuals are fertile and achondroplasia is transmitted as a fully penetrant autosomal dominant trait, accounting for rare familial forms of the disease (10%). In contrast, homozygous achondroplasia is usually lethal in the neonatal period and affects 25% of the offspring of matings between heterozygous achondroplasia parents. The gene responsible for achondroplasia has been mapped to chromosome 4p16.3 (refs 7, 8); the genetic interval encompassing the disease gene contains a member of the fibroblast-growth-factor receptor (FGFR3) family which is expressed in articular chondrocytes. Here we report the finding of recurrent missense mutations in a CpG doublet of the transmembrane domain of the FGFR3 protein (glycine substituted with arginine at residue 380, G380R) in 17 sporadic cases and 6 unrelated familial forms of achondroplasia. We show that the mutant genotype segregates with the disease in these families. Thus it appears that recurrent mutations of a single amino acid in the transmembrane domain of the FGFR3 protein account for all cases (23/23) of achondroplasia in our series.",

Of these, 150 had a G-to-A transition at nt 1138, and 3 had a G-to-C transversion at this same position. On the basis of estimates of the prevalence of achondroplasia, the mutation rate at the FGFR3 1138 guanosine nucleotide is two to three orders of magnitude higher than that previously reported for tranversions and transitions in CpG dinucleotides. To date, this represents the most mutable single nucleotide reported in the human genome. The homogeneity of mutations in achondroplasia is unprecedented for an autosomal dominant disorder and may explain the relative lack of heterogeneity in the achondroplasia phenotype.",

Although 98% of ACH cases are accounted for by a single G380R substitution in the TM, a common mutation (N540K) in the TK1 region is detected in only 60-65% of HCH cases. The aim of this study was to determine whether the frequency of mutations in patients with HCH was the result of incomplete mutation screening or genetic heterogeneity. Eighteen exons of the FGFR3 gene were entirely sequenced in a cohort of 25 HCH and one ACH patients in whom common mutations had been excluded. Seven novel missense FGFR3 mutations were identified, one causing ACH and six resulting in HCH. Six of these substitutions were located in the extracellular region and four of them creating additional cysteine residues, were associated with severe phenotypes. No mutations were detected in 19 clinically diagnosed HCH patients. Our results demonstrate that the spectrum of FGFR3 mutations causing short-limb dwarfism is wider than originally recognised and emphasise the requirement for complete screening of the FGFR3 gene if appropriate genetic counselling is to be offered to patients with HCH or ACH lacking the most common mutations and their families.",

        "abstract": "RATIONALE: Thoracic aortic aneurysms leading to acute aortic dissections (TAAD) can be inherited in families in an autosomal dominant manner. As part of the spectrum of clinical heterogeneity of familial TAAD, we recently described families with multiple members that had TAAD and intracranial aneurysms or TAAD and intracranial and abdominal aortic aneurysms inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. OBJECTIVE: To identify the causative mutation in a large family with autosomal dominant inheritance of TAAD with intracranial and abdominal aortic aneurysms by performing exome sequencing of 2 distantly related individuals with TAAD and identifying shared rare variants. METHODS AND RESULTS: A novel frame shift mutation, p. N218fs (c.652delA), was identified in the SMAD3 gene and segregated with the vascular diseases in this family with a logarithm of odds score of 2.52. Sequencing of 181 probands with familial TAAD identified 3 additional SMAD3 mutations in 4 families, p.R279K (c.836G>A), p.E239K (c.715G>A), and p.A112V (c.235C>T), resulting in a combined logarithm of odds score of 5.21. These 4 mutations were notably absent in 2300 control exomes. SMAD3 mutations were recently described in patients with aneurysms osteoarthritis syndrome and some of the features of this syndrome were identified in individuals in our cohort, but these features were notably absent in many SMAD3 mutation carriers. CONCLUSIONS: SMAD3 mutations are responsible for 2% of familial TAAD. Mutations are found in families with TAAD alone, along with families with TAAD, intracranial aneurysms, abdominal aortic and bilateral iliac aneurysms segregating in an autosomal dominant manner.",

Our 3-year-old propositus underwent correction of an inguinal hernia at 3 months and substitution of the ascending aorta for pathologic dilation at 12 months of age. Family history reveals aortic dilation in his mother at 30 years, death due to aortic dissection of an 18-year-old maternal aunt, surgical replacement of the ascending aorta because of aneurysm in a maternal uncle at 19 years, postpartum death of the maternal grandmother at 24 years and surgical intervention because of thoracic aortic aneurysm in a brother of the propositus' grandmother at 54 years. The affected individuals present with several other signs of connective tissue disease, but the two adult patients evaluated revealed no radiologic evidence of osteoarthritis. Molecular testing of the TGFBR1 and TGFBR2 genes, involved in LDS, resulted negative, but analysis of SMAD3 disclosed the novel heterozygous loss-of-function mutation c.1170_1179del (p.Ser391AlafsX7) in exon 9 in all affected family members, confirming the diagnosis of AOS. SMAD3 mutations should be considered in patients of all ages with LDS-like phenotypes and negative TGFBR1/2 molecular tests, especially in the presence of aortic root or ascending aortic aneurysms, even though signs of early onset osteoarthritis are absent.",

AOS is caused by mutations in the SMAD3 gene. METHODS: A cohort of 393 patients with aneurysms without mutation in FBN1, TGFBR1 and TGFBR2 was screened for mutations in SMAD3. The patients originated from The Netherlands, Belgium, Switzerland and USA. The clinical phenotype in a total of 45 patients from eight different AOS families with eight different SMAD3 mutations is described. In all patients with a SMAD3 mutation, clinical records were reviewed and extensive genetic, cardiovascular and orthopaedic examinations were performed. RESULTS: Five novel SMAD3 mutations (one nonsense, two missense and two frame-shift mutations) were identified in five new AOS families. A follow-up description of the three families with a SMAD3 mutation previously described by the authors was included. In the majority of patients, early-onset joint abnormalities, including osteoarthritis and osteochondritis dissecans, were the initial symptom for which medical advice was sought. Cardiovascular abnormalities were present in almost 90% of patients, and involved mainly aortic aneurysms and dissections. Aneurysms and tortuosity were found in the aorta and other arteries throughout the body, including intracranial arteries. Of the patients who first presented with joint abnormalities, 20% died suddenly from aortic dissection. The presence of mild craniofacial abnormalities including hypertelorism and abnormal uvula may aid the recognition of this syndrome. CONCLUSION: The authors provide further insight into the phenotype of AOS with SMAD3 mutations, and present recommendations for a clinical work-up.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Fanconi anemia (FA) is a rare inherited genetic syndrome with highly variable clinical manifestations. Fifteen genetic subtypes of FA have been identified. Traditional complementation tests for grouping studies have been used generally in FA patients and in stepwise methods to identify the FA type, which can result in incomplete genetic information from FA patients. METHODS: We diagnosed five pediatric patients with FA based on clinical manifestations, and we performed exome sequencing of peripheral blood specimens from these patients and their family members. The related sequencing data were then analyzed by bioinformatics, and the FANC gene mutations identified by exome sequencing were confirmed by PCR re-sequencing. RESULTS: Homozygous and compound heterozygous mutations of FANC genes were identified in all of the patients. The FA subtypes of the patients included FANCA, FANCM and FANCD2. Interestingly, four FA patients harbored multiple mutations in at least two FA genes, and some of these mutations have not been previously reported. These patients' clinical manifestations were vastly different from each other, as were their treatment responses to androstanazol and prednisone. This finding suggests that heterozygous mutation(s) in FA genes could also have diverse biological and/or pathophysiological effects on FA patients or FA gene carriers. Interestingly, we were not able to identify de novo mutations in the genes implicated in DNA repair pathways when the sequencing data of patients were compared with those of their parents. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that Chinese FA patients and carriers might have higher and more complex mutation rates in FANC genes than have been conventionally recognized. Testing of the fifteen FANC genes in FA patients and their family members should be a regular clinical practice to determine the optimal care for the individual patient, to counsel the family and to obtain a better understanding of FA pathophysiology.",

        "abstract": "Angiotensin II type-2 receptor gene (AGTR2) mutations have been recently detected in patients with mental retardation. AGTR2 plays a role in central nervous system development and cognitive functions. We identified a novel missense mutation of c.572G>A (p.G191E) in a 6-year-old boy showing severe mental retardation, pervasive developmental disorder, and epilepsy. This is the first report on AGTR2 mutation in a Japanese boy with mental retardation.",
