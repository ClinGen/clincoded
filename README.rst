This software creates an object store and user interface for the collection of mappings between human diseases and genetic variation as input by the ClinGen curation staff.

Baseline Dependendencies
=========================

Mac OSX
--------
Step 1a: Verify that homebrew is working properly::

    $ brew doctor


Step 2a: Install or update dependencies::

    $ brew install libevent libmagic libxml2 libxslt elasticsearch openssl postgresql graphviz
    $ brew install freetype libjpeg libtiff littlecms webp chromedriver # Required by Pillow

Note: For Mac < 10.9, the system python doesn't work. You should install Python with Homebrew::

    $ brew install python3

Install Node 0.10 from homebrew/versions::

    $ brew tap homebrew/versions
    $ brew install node010

If you need to update dependencies::

    $ brew update
    $ brew upgrade
    $ make clean

You can also use the Makefile to set up for a clean buildout::

    $ make clean

Then proceed to step 1b.

Linux
-----

See cloud-config.yml in this repository.  Use apt-get or yum or other package manager to install everything under packages.   The rest of the install instructions assume you have python3.4 in your path.

Install python, node and ruby dependencies
==========================================

Note: These will all be installed locally for the application and should never conflict with other system packages

Step 1b: Run buildout::

    $ python3.4 bootstrap.py -v 2.3.1 --setuptools-version 15.2
    $ bin/buildout

If you see a clang error like this::

    clang: error: unknown argument: '-mno-fused-madd' [-Wunused-command-line-argument-hard-error-in-future]

You can try::

    $ ARCHFLAGS=-Wno-error=unused-command-line-argument-hard-error-in-future bin/buildout

If it does not exist, set a session key::

    $ cat /dev/urandom | head -c 256 | base64 > session-secret.b64

Start the application locally
================================

In one terminal startup the database servers with::

    $ bin/dev-servers development.ini --app-name app --clear --init --load

This will first clear any existing data in /tmp/clincoded.
Then postgres and elasticsearch servers will be initiated within /tmp/clincoded.
The servers are started, and finally the test set will be loaded.

In a second terminal, run the app in with::

    $ bin/pserve development.ini

Indexing will then proceed in a background thread similar to the production setup.

Browse to the interface at http://localhost:6543/.

Run the tests locally  (tests also run on travis-ci with every push)
========================

To run specific tests locally::

    $ bin/test -k test_name

To run with a debugger::

    $ bin/test --pdb

Specific tests to run locally for schema changes::

    $ bin/test -k test_load_workbook

Run the Pyramid tests with::

    $ bin/test -m "not bdd"

Run the Browser tests with::

    $ bin/test -m bdd -v -v

Run the Javascript tests with::

    $ npm test

Or if you need to supply command line arguments::

    $ ./node_modules/.bin/jest

Notes on modifying the local (Postgres) database
=====================================

Note:  The below is generally superceeded by the dev-servers command which creates a temporary PG db, then throws it away.  But this might be useful for some deep debugging.

If you wish a clean db wipe for DEVELOPMENT::

    $ dropdb clincoded
    ...
    $ createdb clincoded
    $ pg_ctl -D /usr/local/var/postgres -l pg.log start

Database setup on VMs::

    # service postgresql-9.3 initdb
    # service postgresql-9.3 start
    # sudo -u postgres createuser --createdb clincoded

Then as the clincoded user::

    $ createdb clincoded

To dump a postgres database:
    pg_dump -Fc clincoded > FILE_NAME  (as user clincoded on demo vm)
    (FILE_NAME for production is ~/clincoded/archive/clincoded-YYYYMMDD.dump)

To restore a postgres database:
    pg_restore -d clincoded FILE_NAME (as user clincoded on demo vm)

Notes on manually creation of ElasticSearch mapping
--------------------------------------
    $ bin/create-mapping production.ini

Notes on SASS/Compass
=====================

`SASS <http://sass-lang.com/>`_ and `Compass <http://compass-style.org/>`_ are being used. Before running to app, you need to builld the css files by starting 'compass watch' or doing a 'compass compile' (see below).

Installing
----------

Both can be installed via Ruby gems::

    $ gem install sass
    $ gem install compass

Compiling "on the fly"
----------------------

Compass can watch for any changes made to .scss files and instantly compile them to .css. To start this, from the root of the project (where config.rb is) do::

    $ compass watch

You can specify whether the compiled CSS is minified or not in config.rb. (Currently, it is set to minify.)

Force compiling
---------------

    $ compass compile

Again, you can specify whether the compiled CSS is minified or not in config.rb.

Also see the `Compass Command Line Documentation <http://compass-style.org/help/tutorials/command-line/>`_ and the `Configuration Reference <http://compass-style.org/help/tutorials/configuration-reference/>`_.

And of course::

    $ compass help


Notes on SublimeLinter
=============

To setup SublimeLinter with Sublime Text 3, first install the linters::

    $ easy_install-2.7 flake8
    $ npm install -g jshint
    $ npm install -g jsxhint

After first setting up `Package Control`_ (follow install and usage instructions on site), use it to install the following packages in Sublime Text 3:

    * sublimelinter
    * sublimelinter-flake8
    * sublimelinter-jsxhint
    * jsx
    * sublimelinter-jshint
