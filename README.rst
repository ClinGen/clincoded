This software creates an object store and user interface for the collection of mappings between human diseases and genetic variation as input by the ClinGen curation staff.

Baseline Dependendencies
=========================

You will need a system with at least 2GB of available memory - ``npm install`` will need
about 1GB to succeed, while elasticsearch will need at least 2GB for the JVM.

Mac OSX
--------
If you do not have homebrew installed, you can get it at `brew.sh
<https://brew.sh/>`_.

#. Verify that homebrew is working properly::

    $ brew doctor


#.  Install or update dependencies

    ::

    $ brew install libevent libmagic libxml2 libxslt openssl graphviz
    $ brew install freetype libjpeg libtiff littlecms webp
    $ brew tap homebrew/cask
    $ brew cask install chromedriver # required for pillow


    Note: For Mac < 10.9, the system python doesn't work. You should install Python 3.4.x; the
    preferred method is to use pyEnv, covered further down the list

#. Install Git (use ``git --version`` to check if it's already installed)
   ::

    $ brew install git

#. Install Java JDK 1.8
   ::

    $ brew tap AdoptOpenJDK/openjdk
    $ brew cask install adoptopenjdk8

#. Install postgres
   ::

    $ brew install postgresql@9.4

#. Install elasticsearch

   - First, download `v1.7.4 <https://www.elastic.co/downloads/past-releases/elasticsearch-1-7-4>`_.
   - Next, unpack the tarball into a directory of your choice; suggested location is ``/opt/elasticsearch``.
   - Finally, create symbolic links to the install location

   ::

        $ ln -s [install location]/bin/elasticsearch /usr/local/bin/elasticsearch
        $ ln -s [install location]/bin/elasticsearch.in.sh /usr/local/bin/elasticsearch.in.sh


#. Install Node v6 (v6 is the current LTS version https://github.com/nodejs/LTS#lts-schedule ):

  * check node version::

      $ node --version

  * install via homebrew (homebrew will indicate if you need to unlink a prior version of node)::

      $ brew install node@6

  * or install via nvm::

      $ npm install -g nvm
      $ nvm install 6
      $ nvm use 6

  * it may be necessary to update the PATH environment variable (including a profile update, such as to ``~/.bash_profile``)::

      $ export PATH=/usr/local/opt/node@6/bin:$PATH

  * ensure you are using npm 3 (check version: ``npm --version``), if necessary update npm to npm 3::

      $ npm install npm -g


#. Install pyEnv and python 3.4

   ::

   $ brew install pyenv
   $ pyenv install 3.4.3


   If pyEnv fails on installation, this may help: https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv/wiki/Common-build-problems

   To enable shims (which the global command requires), add the following to the shell (i.e. at the end of ``~/.bash_profile``)
   ::

        if command -v pyenv 1>/dev/null 2>&1; then
          eval "$(pyenv init -)"
        fi

   To make the newly-installed version of python the system default

   ::

        $ pyenv global 3.4.3

   And to confirm the results

   ::

        $ python â€”version

#. Install six
   ::

    $ pip install six==1.9.0

#. Install Sass/Compass
   ::

    $ gem install sass
    $ gem install compass

If you need to update dependencies::

    $ brew update
    $ brew upgrade
    $ make clean

You can also use the Makefile to set up for a clean buildout::

    $ make clean

Build the application
=====================

Run buildout::

    $ python3.4 bootstrap.py -v 2.9.5 --setuptools-version 15.2
    $ bin/buildout -c buildout-dev.cfg

If you see a clang error like this::

    clang: error: unknown argument: '-mno-fused-madd' [-Wunused-command-line-argument-hard-error-in-future]

You can try::

    $ ARCHFLAGS=-Wno-error=unused-command-line-argument-hard-error-in-future bin/buildout

If it does not exist, set a session key::

    $ cat /dev/urandom | head -c 256 | base64 > session-secret.b64

Start the application locally
================================

In one terminal startup the database servers with::

    $ bin/dev-servers development.ini --app-name app --clear --init --load

This will first clear any existing data in /tmp/clincoded.
Then postgres and elasticsearch servers will be initiated within /tmp/clincoded.
The servers are started, and finally the test set will be loaded.

In a second terminal, run the app in with::

    $ bin/pserve development.ini

Indexing will then proceed in a background thread similar to the production setup.

Browse to the interface at http://localhost:6543/.

Run the tests locally  (tests also run on travis-ci with every push)
====================================================================

To run specific tests locally::

    $ bin/test -k test_name

To run with a debugger::

    $ bin/test --pdb

Specific tests to run locally for schema changes::

    $ bin/test -k test_load_workbook

Run the Pyramid tests with::

    $ bin/test -m "not bdd"

Run the Browser tests with::

    $ bin/test -m bdd -v -v

Run the Javascript tests with::

    $ npm test

Or if you need to supply command line arguments::

    $ ./node_modules/.bin/jest

Notes on modifying the local (Postgres) database
================================================

Note:  The below is generally superceeded by the dev-servers command which creates a temporary PG db, then throws it away.  But this might be useful for some deep debugging.

If you wish a clean db wipe for DEVELOPMENT::

    $ dropdb clincoded
    ...
    $ createdb clincoded
    $ pg_ctl -D /usr/local/var/postgres -l pg.log start

Database setup on VMs::

    # service postgresql-9.4 initdb
    # service postgresql-9.4 start
    # sudo -u postgres createuser --createdb clincoded

Then as the clincoded user::

    $ createdb clincoded

To dump a postgres database:
    pg_dump -Fc clincoded > FILE_NAME  (as user clincoded on demo vm)
    (FILE_NAME for production is ~/clincoded/archive/clincoded-YYYYMMDD.dump)

To restore a postgres database:
    pg_restore -d clincoded FILE_NAME (as user clincoded on demo vm)

Notes on manual creation of ElasticSearch mapping
-------------------------------------------------
    $ bin/create-mapping production.ini

Notes on SASS/Compass
=====================

`SASS <http://sass-lang.com/>`_ and `Compass <http://compass-style.org/>`_ are being used. Before running to app, you need to builld the css files by starting 'compass watch' or doing a 'compass compile' (see below).

Compiling "on the fly"
----------------------

Compass can watch for any changes made to .scss files and instantly compile them to .css. To start this, from the root of the project (where config.rb is) do::

    $ compass watch

You can specify whether the compiled CSS is minified or not in config.rb. (Currently, it is set to minify.)

Force compiling
---------------

    $ compass compile

Again, you can specify whether the compiled CSS is minified or not in config.rb.

Also see the `Compass Command Line Documentation <http://compass-style.org/help/tutorials/command-line/>`_ and the `Configuration Reference <http://compass-style.org/help/tutorials/configuration-reference/>`_.

And of course::

    $ compass help


Notes on SublimeLinter
======================

To setup SublimeLinter with Sublime Text 3, first install the linters::

    $ easy_install-2.7 flake8
    $ npm install -g eslint
    $ npm install -g eslint-plugin-react

After first setting up `Package Control`_ (follow install and usage instructions on site), use it to install the following packages in Sublime Text 3:

    * sublimelinter
    * sublimelinter-flake8
    * SublimeLinter-contrib-eslint (`eslint instructions <https://github.com/roadhump/SublimeLinter-eslint#plugin-installation>`_)
    * babel (`babel instructions <https://github.com/babel/babel-sublime#setting-as-the-default-syntax>`_)

.. _`Package Control`: https://sublime.wbond.net/

Troubleshooting the install
===========================
- The ``[parts, bin]`` directories are generated by the bootstrapping process.  It's safe to delete this directory and re-run the bootstrapper if you run into errors during the buildout step
- **OSX**: nvm may fail with xcode related issues.  If so, this may help: https://github.com/nodejs/node-gyp/issues/569
- Postgres server not responding?  Start the Postgres server if it hasn't yet started.  You can check by running:

  ::

        $ psql --username=postgres --host=/tmp/clincoded/pgdata/

  This should put you into the Potgres CLI.  If it's not running, you can start it by running:

  ::

        $ pg_ctl -D /tmp/clincoded/pgdata -l psql_log.log start

  Note that the ``-l`` option indicates a log file - suggested location is ``/var/log/postgres``
